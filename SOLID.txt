SOLID Principles

I believe I used the single Responsibility principles in my TCPServer class. All the methods I used in
that class are doing one specific things. For example the method "ListeningForMessage()" only do one
task which listen for users message and output the message.

I believe I used the Dependency Inversion Principle throughout my project. Most of my method does not depend on one another 
but on abstrations.
